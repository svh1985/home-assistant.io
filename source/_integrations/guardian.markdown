The `guardian` integration integrates
[Elexa Guardian water valve controllers](https://getguardian.com) into Home Assistant.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- **Binary Sensor**: reports the status of the onboard leak detector and access point
- **Sensor**: reports on the device's detected temperature and uptime
- **Switch**: allows the user to open and close the valve

## Configuration

This integration can be configured via the Home Assistant UI by navigating to
**Configuration** -> **Integrations**. If you have the `zeroconf` integration enabled,
Home Assistant will automatically discover any Guardian devices already connected to the
network.
